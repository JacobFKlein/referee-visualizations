Executive Summary
-----------------

In examining penalties called in the National Football League (NFL), we found that away teams (i.e. teams that are not playing at their home field/stadium) are penalized significantly more often than are home teams. This suggests that there exists some inherent biases in penalties called by referees in the NFL. Independent of the location of the game, one should expect that teams play the same (and thus commit the same number of legitimate penalties on average) in every game they play, but the findings of this analysis show that referees favor teams playing at home.
