## Introduction

The National Football League (NFL) is arguably the most popular professional sports association in the United States. The NFL consists of 32 teams, and each team plays 16 games per season - this figure does not include playoff games, for which only a select subset of the 32 teams qualify. Every game is divided into four quarters of length 15 minutes, and each team's objective is to score more points than their opponent. Each team wants to defend their own end zone while attacking their opponent's end zone. Points in the NFL are awarded for touchdowns, extra points, safeties, and field goals. Detailed knowledge of football scoring is not particularly crucial for the purposes of comprehending the following analysis, but it may prove helpful in specific discussions.

Every NFL game is watched by a group of seven officials, which includes one referee, one umpire, and five line judges. These officials are responsible for watching and arbitrating plays, and deeming any illegal plays as penalties. When a penalty is called by an official, the penalty is enforced by moving the penalized team in their adverse direction by a pre-specified number of yards - common penalties are enforced with 5-, 10-, and 15- yard penalties.

The purpose of this project is to examine tendencies, biases, and patterns in penalties called by officials. It is important to note that we only consider calls made by referees in this analysis, since referees are most responsible for the play of game and are the appointed head official for their respective games.

Our interest in sports, and interest in the NFL specifically, prompted us to research this topic. From an NFL fan and spectator perspective, an increasing amount of attention has been placed on penalties called over the course of the past five or so years. There is often contention regarding how one can actually define a specific penalty, how to determine if one occurred, and why some teams appear to be penalized significantly more or less often than do others. Penalties can dramatically alter the flow and outcomes of games, so ensuring that penalties are called fairly and consistently is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the game.

## Data Collection

Data for this analysis was collected from the past five seasons, beginning with the 2013-2014 NFL season. It should be noted that this analysis was conducted during the 2018-2019 NFL season. Thus we have included all data available for the current season, but this season was excluded in any analyses in which penalties were compared over entire seasons, since all data for the season will not be available until February 2019.

We downloaded play-by-play data from NFLsavant.com:

From this site, we downloaded CSV files from seasons beginning in 2013 through 2018. These six CSV files begin with "pbp" and are located within the "/data" folder of this repository.

We then downloaded referee game data from Pro-Football-Reference:

As noted above, because there are hundreds of referees, linesmen, side judges, and line judges employed by the NFL, for the purposes of this analysis we focused only on referees. We also excluded any referees who have not been employed by the NFL for a sufficient amount of time (and thus do not yield sufficient data points); all referees in our dataset have reffed over 700 games.

A CSV file is available in the "/data" subfolder for each of the 17 referees we included in the analysis.

Also included in the "/data" subfolder is a file called "abbreviations.csv". This file is an aid in joining the play-by-play data to the referee data, and includes a mapping of team names to team abbreviations. For example, this file maps team name "Arizona Cardinals" to team abbreviation "ARI".

## Conclusion

While many unique insights were uncovered through this analysis, there remain a few interesting directions in which we can proceed to perform further exploratory data analysis.

As noted above, home teams are penalized significantly less often than are away teams. This is a trend we found consistent across all teams, just about all referees, and across all quarters of games. Most NFL seasons, some games (generally less than three or four) are played at neutral fields, either in another country or at a pre-determined destination in the United States (as is the case for the Super Bowl). A limitation with this potential exploration include a significantly smaller sample size than what was used in this analysis. Moreover, we would need to be careful to filter out games that are technically at a neutral location but where one team still has locational advantage (for example if the New York Jets played the Minnesota Vikings at the New York Giants stadium). In carrying out such an analysis, we suspect that this would yield a much more balanced distribution of penalties called against opposing teams when neither team is playing at their home field.
